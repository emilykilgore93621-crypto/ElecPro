    "reasoning": "This Firestore structure prioritizes security and scalability for the WattsUp Electrical Toolkit application, focusing on user authentication and data isolation.  The core principle is Authorization Independence, achieved through path-based ownership.  Each user's data is stored under their unique user ID, eliminating the need for complex `get()` calls in security rules and ensuring atomic operations are possible.\n\nThe `/users/{userId}` collection stores user profile information. This path structure ensures that only the authenticated user (identified by `request.auth.uid`) can access their own data, providing a solid foundation for data privacy.\n\nThe structure inherently supports QAPs (Rules are not Filters) because each user's data is isolated under their `userId`. List operations are secure as rules can simply verify that `request.auth.uid == userId`.\n\nAuthentication providers are 'password' and 'anonymous', requiring secure handling on the client-side using Firebase Authentication."
